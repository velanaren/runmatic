## Last Session

```
Date:                2026-04-23
Sprint:              14 — Pods & Deployments
What was built:      api-deployment.yaml — 2 replica Runmatic API Deployment with resource requests/limits.
                     Proved reconciliation loop (pod deleted → replaced in 7s). Triggered a deliberate
                     rolling update to a non-existent image, observed ErrImageNeverPull, waited for
                     progressDeadlineExceeded (600s), rolled back with kubectl rollout undo.
Key concept:         Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pod. The Deployment manages ReplicaSets, not pods directly.
                     rollout undo works by scaling the old ReplicaSet back up — it was dormant, not gone.
                     progressDeadlineExceeded marks the Deployment degraded but does NOT auto-rollback.
What was missed:     Phase 4 explanation didn't name ReplicaSet as the intermediate layer. No readiness or
                     liveness probes in the manifest — pods show Ready based on process running, not app health.
Carry forward:       DATABASE_URL points to postgres:5432 — that hostname doesn't exist in K8s yet.
                     Sprint 15 creates a ClusterIP Service for postgres, registering the DNS name the API
                     needs to connect to the database.
Next session:        Sprint 15 — Services & DNS (stable endpoints and inter-service DNS for Runmatic)
